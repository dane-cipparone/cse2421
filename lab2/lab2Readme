Comments: While debugging I found it more readable to separate each element of the data sets by a newline.
            The lab document said to use tabs, so it was a stylistic choice. I also found it interesting that
            we have to prompt the user for the number of the data set to calculate on before they have the
            opportunity to end the program. If there are multiple prompts, doesn't it make more sense to put
            the option to exit on the first one?
Debugger: I used the debugger to see if the program was reading the data sets into arrays correctly. I set
            a breakpoint on the method 'dataSet' by entering "break dataSet", and ran the program. I stepped through
            the first data set and on the second, printed out the values in the data set by accessing the
            array's elements via subscripts, and printed out the number of values read in by the program. I have
            included some of the output.
Debugger Output:

            enter data set 2: 3 4 5 6
            47        dataSet.head = data(count);
            (gdb) print count
            $2 = 3
            (gdb) next
            48        dataSet.count = count;
            (gdb) print dataSet.head
