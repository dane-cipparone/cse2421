3) I can't remember if Prof. Kirby mentioned this in class, but the lab document says to use two unsigned chars to calculated the product. This wasn't possible since the value being shifted to the left needs to be able to grow to 2 bytes (since the size of the product is two bytes). So, I used an unsigned short for shifting to the left -- the same type as the product variable. Also, I found it easiest to ensure the user's input was valid by scanning into 3 variable, 2 for the integers to multiply and one for a char to represent the blank space between the ints. If this char is not ' ', input is invalid.
